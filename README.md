## ðŸ§  Game Logic

The game is based on a 1D character array that represents a 3Ã—3 board. Each player chooses a position between 1â€“9, and the program updates the array accordingly. After each move, the game checks for a winning condition (rows, columns, diagonals) or a draw.

```c
char b[] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'};
